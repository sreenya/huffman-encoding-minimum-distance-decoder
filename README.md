# huffman-encoding-minimum-distance-decoder
This repo stores the python code for generating a huffman code of given parameters and also stores the code for the implementation of a minimum distance decoder.
Both of these have been thoroughly tested. 
## Huffman coding
This file consists of python code for generating Huffman codes with the given parameters. It also contains code for the analysis on the variation on different parameters. 
## q1_file1, q2_file2, q2_file3, q2_file4
These are the files used for the testing of the huffman code generator. 
##
This simulates a binary symmetric channel and a minimum distance decoder. It checks how effective the decoder is and performs graphical analysis for the different parameters.
